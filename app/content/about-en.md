# I am **Noah**, a programmer, enthusiastic runner and traveler.

Currently, I live in Da Nang, writing code and exploring new running routes every day.

Since childhood, I've loved technology and sports. I wrote my first program when I was just 10 years old on an old computer my father brought home. It was a simple game, but it sparked my passion for programming.

Besides computers, I'm also passionate about running. At 12, I participated in a homemade obstacle course in my backyard, wearing my brother's old protective gear and counting down from three before taking off. I imagined I was conquering new limits â€” even though that time I fell and had to wear a cast on my leg for several weeks!

Afterwards, I spent many summers researching nutrition and training methods, while combining my programming knowledge to create personal health tracking tools. One of my memorable projects was a small application that helped me measure my running distance and optimize my diet.

Now, I am both a web development programmer and an enthusiastic runner. I have participated in many interesting technology projects and numerous running competitions throughout Vietnam. This blog is where I share my experiences about **technology**, **endurance sports** and **travel**.
